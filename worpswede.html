      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>After visting Bremen, we were supposed to go to Hamburg. However, after our Hamburg airbnb host attempted to screw us over, we 
        cancelled our airbnb reservation a few days before our departure for Germany. Airbnb handled the whole thing pretty well, 
        at least in terms of refunding us our money. If you're ever looking to stay at an airbnb in Hamburg, check with us first to 
        make sure you don't end up with the same skeezy lady (our experience is not reflected in her "superhost" reviews). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now without a place to stay for two nights, we looked for other places around Bremen or Hamburg. We found a 
        <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33483565?source_impression_id=p3_1563666415_mGK0hYhp0HLsVIQd" target="_blank">farm</a> to stay at in Worpswede, about an hour north of Bremen. Worpswede is a small, idyllic 
        town. The areas we saw were quite rural and full of nature - and corn, so much corn. Apparently a lot of corn is grown 
        in the area (we're not sure if it's feed corn or people corn).

        We had to take a rather local bus to Worpswede. During the week, it runs about once an hour; on the weekends, only a few 
        times a day. We had a bit of an adventure buying our bus tickets, as the machine in Bremen didn't dispense our second ticket. 
        Efforts to get our money back have, to date, been unsuccessful. I'd recommend just paying on the bus if you're in the same 
        situation so that you don't end up in the, well, same situation.
        <br><br>
        We were both tired by the time we got on the bus, and one of us got a nap.

      <p>
        The bus let us off in the middle of a rural/residential neighborhood, and we then had to walk about a kilometer and a half 
        to our airbnb. I was a bit envious of the multiple bicyclists we passed - the roads were well paved, had plenty of shade, 
        and would be perfect for riding a bike around.  
      </p>
      <p>
        After a relaxing walk (admittedly, it would have been more relaxing without our bags), we eventually arrived at our airbnb. 
        Our host's father greeted us. I understood almost all of what he said, although he spoke only German. Thanks, high school 
        German 20 years ago! We then found our hostess, Mara, who showed us around the farm and to our quarters (which exceeded 
        our expectations - this was probably my favorite airbnb experience ever).

      <p>
        We knew it wouldn't be easy to get to restaurants or stores, and we weren't sure if we'd have access to a refrigerator, 
        so we bought all of our food for our two days in Worpswede before we left Bremen. We brought pastries, baguettes, rolls, cheese, 
        bell peppers, a cucumber, and hard sausages. And, of course, water, candy, and soda. Gotta have the essentials. It turned out 
        there was indeed a refrigerator and our fears were for naught. But for our two days in Worpswede, we lived on a combination 
        of (mostly) carbs and cheese.

        We didn't do any shopping in Worpswede, though I know there are shops in town. For the two days we were there, I only 
        hung around on the farm and recuperated to prepare for Berlin. Sean hiked out to the nature area a couple kilometers 
        away, but if he bought anything, I never saw it (I'm pretty sure that's because he didn't actually buy anything).
