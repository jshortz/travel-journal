      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        We knew we wanted to go to Berlin, had wanted to go to Berlin for many months. We'd debated at some length <i>when</i> 
        to go, because there's so incredibly much to do in Berlin that we were afraid of taking a shorter trip and feeling 
        like we hadn't seen enough. When we realized that <i>everyone</i> in Sweden leaves town for July (no, really), we 
        decided to go ahead and take the plunge. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I love cities. Generally, the bigger the better. I love the vastness of them, the 
        crowds, the way you can find anything, all the history and <i>life</i> crammed into one place. Tokyo is my favorite place 
        in the world, and I feel similarly gushy 
        about London and to a lesser degree (it gets dinged for being relatively new) New York. I know Berlin is one of the other 
        great metropolises of the world, so seeing it was high on my list. 
      </p>

      <h1>Getting There <span style="font-size:32%;">(<a href="https://jshortz.github.io/travel-journal/berlin.html">Top</a>)</span></h1>
      <p>
        Depending on what review you read, you  might think that Flixbus is either an awesome low-cost way to travel or terrible 
        and to be avoided at all costs. Although we love trains and could have taken one to Berlin, we opted to take a Flixbus 
        instead, saving somewhere around 50 euros overall. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We booked our Flixbus back when we booked our initial Airbnbs, so we booked a Flixbus from Hamburg to Berlin. Leaving from 
        Worpswede, we had to first get to Hamburg to pick up the Flixbus. This involved getting up at six in the morning to board 
        the local bus back to Bremen, where we took a train to Hamburg (we couldn't let our trip be completely train-less). The 
        train had designated bicycle cars, where the top deck was seats and the bottom was just bicycle storage. I thought that was 
        pretty neat. </p>
      <p>Eventually, we arrived at Hamburg Station, which was huge and quite a thing to behold. We immediately noticed that it felt 
        very different from Bremen, even though they're less than an hour apart. Hamburg felt grittier, more touristy, more capitalist. 
        We saw a lot more homelessness and desperate looking folks, even in the few hours that we were in Hamburg. Perhaps this was 
        just the area around the station; we admittedly saw very little of Hamburg. Right outside the station, we did find a little 
        piece of home: a KFC. A couple of these exist in Sweden, but none convenient to where we are.
      </p>
      <p>During the Flixbus ride to Berlin, we saw more of the endless corn fields we'd noticed around Worpswede. We also 
        saw huge swaths of solar panels, something I've never seen in the U.S. I expected there to be city between Hamburg and Berlin 
        (the trip takes around four hours, so it's not an inconsiderable distance), but it was mostly rural, fields full of crops or trees.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a very uneventful ride on the Flixbus, we arrived in Berlin proper. The bus pulled into the central Berlin bus station, 
        which is disappointingly unconnected to any other forms of public transit. We walked a couple blocks to the nearest U-Bahn 
        station, where we found the process to buy our transit passes incredibly painless. Unlike Stockholm and many other cities, 
        Berlin has no gates to entry to its public transportation. Instead, they rely on fare enforcement officers. We didn't see one 
        during our trip, but we imagine they must come through regularly.

        You'd think that really huge cities would have a variety of food, from bad to mediocre to excellent. But so far, that 
        hasn't been my experience in metropolises. Tokyo has the most amazing food I've ever eaten, and restaurants are 
        consistently excellent. Most of the food we ate in London was well above average as well. Berlin is keeping up the trend. 
        Food, whether from extremely highly rated fancy restaurants or from local dives, was consistently high quality during our 
        trip.

            Technically, this wasn't in Berlin. But we've lumped together our short time in Hamburg with our time in Berlin, so...

          Our first night in Berlin, we went to Botania, a special event at the Berlin Botanical Garden. They had what felt like an 
          endless set of vendors selling all sorts of food, which we happily nommed... until a massive thunderstorm shut the whole 
          event down (more on that below)

          After arriving back from Botania, drenched and hypothermic, we found that we were hungry and thirsty too. And this was 
          a problem, because the fiasco of getting home had left us returning home just before midnight. However, we noticed this 
          rather small restaurant open. It turns out it's a Turkish restaurant. We shared a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doner_kebab" target="_blank">doner</a> 
          sandwich that first night (all evidence eaten before pictures were thought about), but were impressed by how good it tasted. 
          We vowed to return in the future for more evidence. And indeed, we went back more than once. In addition to the 
          excellent doner, we found a special curry that we both love. Top it off with the fact that the staff is super friendly and 
          sweet, and it quickly became one of our favorite "local" joints.

          the decor/ambience was unique, and the burgers were spectacular. (Sean thinks likely the best burger he's ever had; I

          When we were planning what to do in Berlin, we discovered an event on Facebook for a trio of shamisen players. Going 
          to see them (more below) led us to discover Klunkerkranich, a rooftop garden, bar, restaurant, and music venue with 
          an incredibly relaxed and unique vibe.

          just down the street from where we were staying, so we knew we'd eventually try it out. I took pictures of our food, 
          but they came out terribly blurry, so you'll just have to trust that our food existed. I got a peanut coconut curry, 
          and it was easily the best Vietnamese I've had (I'm generally not a fan of Vietnamese, except banh mi). Sean got a 
          beef pho and I think it mostly made him miss <a href="http://www.thanbrothers.com/#/" target="_blank">

          (more like disorganized crowd) for the bus was untenably long, especially since we would have been standing in the deluge, 
          freezing and wet. So we walked to the nearest U-Bahn station and returned home. I wrung buckets of water out of my clothes -
